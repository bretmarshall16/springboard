    "# Examining Racial Discrimination in the US Job Market\n",
    "\n",
    "### Background\n",
    "Racial discrimination continues to be pervasive in cultures throughout the world. Researchers examined the level of racial discrimination in the United States labor market by randomly assigning identical résumés to black-sounding or white-sounding names and observing the impact on requests for interviews from employers.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data\n",
    "In the dataset provided, each row represents a resume. The 'race' column has two values, 'b' and 'w', indicating black-sounding and white-sounding. The column 'call' has two values, 1 and 0, indicating whether the resume received a call from employers or not.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the 'b' and 'w' values in race are assigned randomly to the resumes when presented to the employer."

    "   4. Write a story describing the statistical significance in the context or the original problem.\n",
    "   5. Does your analysis mean that race/name is the most important factor in callback success? Why or why not? If not, how would you amend your analysis?\n",

    "    A permutation test is most appropriate for this problem.  There are two charateristics of interest, race and call back.  We state the null hypothese as race has no affect on whether a person is called back or not.  So we randomly assign whether a person was called back or not to white and black sounding names and determine the ratio of callback rate for black vs white sounding names, then calculate the P-value of achieving a value atleast as extreme as what we recorded 157/2435 : 235/2435.  Yes clt applies because there the data set is suficiently large (>30)\n",
