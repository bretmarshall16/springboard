 Create a short document (1-2 pages) in your github describing the data wrangling steps that you undertook to clean your capstone project data set. What kind of cleaning steps did you perform? How did you deal with missing values, if any? Were there outliers, and how did you decide to handle them? This document will eventually become part of your milestone report.

 I was very fortunate that this data set by standford was already cleaned very well. There are missing values but that are filled in with NaN so I didnt need to perform any work there. Also the data doesnt allow for many outliers because there is no quantifiable column such as pounds of drugs discovered or something similar which would allow for an outlier.  There were no outliers in age either, the range is from 15 to 100.  The only cleaning step that i performed was removing the 'raw' columns. Standford went through already columns such as driver_race_raw and cleaned that data so that there are a smaller number of races, and similar races such as 'cauccasian' and 'white' are represented by 'white'.  Therefore I had no need for the raw columns as they would not be used and would only add unnecessary space to the file.
